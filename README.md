# Analysis of ADF vs Power BI dataflows

## Setting up a PBI Dataflow

- [ ] 1. Created a custom workspace in PBI Service.
- [ ] 2. Set up a new sample datasource or connect to an existing one.  In my case, I spun up an Azure SQL Database and use the sample AdventureWorks database. 
- [ ] 3. In PBI Service, used **Get Data** to connect to the my datasource and selected a few sample tables.
- [ ] 4. Transformed the data using the Power query editor, e.g. 
    - [ ] Merged queries
    - [ ] Added/Removed/Renamed Columns
    - [ ] Disabled Load of Tables
    - [ ] Aggregated data
- [ ] 5. Perform an on-demand refresh
- [ ] 6. Refresh based on a schedule
